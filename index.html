         <p>ReactJS is a toolkit for building user interfaces that was first deployed by Facebook in 2011. At its core, React is a solution to a problem that developers faced when building user interfaces. It allows developers to build complex user interfaces which have components that will change frequently over time, without having to write a lot of very tricky JavaScript code.

            While React is a lot like front-end framework, it’s actually a little different in terms of functionality. Technically, it is a user interface library. It includes some of the same aspects of front-end frameworks, but its purpose is to organize HTML elements into components.</p>

            <p>JSX is a powerful implementation detail of React. It’s a cool feature that makes React easy and fun to use because it’s relatively quick to make a feature and rewarding to see it. JSX brings HTML directly into JavaScript and allows you to build HTML within the JavaScript code.

                If you weren’t using React but were using regular JavaScript, you could build an HTML string that you could include on a page. However, it could be a little messy.
